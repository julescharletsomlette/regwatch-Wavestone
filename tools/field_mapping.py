"""Map the comparative workbook's 136 fields onto the country record.

    python3 tools/field_mapping.py            # coverage report
    python3 tools/field_mapping.py --json     # write data/field-mapping.json

This is the piece the Excel -> tool sync depends on. The workbook holds 136
fields per country across 7 sheets; the country record exposes ~25 flat fields
and 7 prose sections. Wiring a sync before knowing which is which would import
into the void, so the mapping is declared here, explicitly, and the script
reports what is left uncovered rather than pretending the job is done.

Three kinds of target:

  flat    a typed field on the record (dates, counts, months) - sortable,
          filterable, chartable. This is where a KPI can come from.
  section a bullet inside one of the record's prose sections - readable context.
  none    deliberately not surfaced (working notes, split EE/IE duplicates,
          columns superseded by another).

A field mapped to `flat` must stay typed end to end: writing "36 months (EE)"
into a numeric field is how a comparison table stops being comparable.
