"""RegWatch chat proxy - an Azure Function that holds the key so the page does not.

RegWatch is a static file. Anything written into it is published: the deployed
page is downloadable by anyone, so a shared Azure OpenAI key baked in would be a
public key, billed to the firm by whoever finds it. This Function is where the
key lives instead. The page calls it and never sees a secret.

It speaks the OpenAI chat-completions shape on purpose, so RegWatch's existing
"OpenAI-compatible" mode points at it with no code change:

    endpoint = https://<app>.azurewebsites.net/api/v1

Application settings (Azure portal -> Configuration, or `az functionapp config
appsettings set`):

    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY        the firm's key - set here, nowhere else
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT       https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT     e.g. gpt-5.4-mini
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION    optional, defaults below
    REGWATCH_ALLOWED_ORIGINS    comma-separated, e.g. https://<organisation>.github.io
                                (a server-side check; the BROWSER-side CORS
                                 headers come from the Function App's own CORS
                                 settings - see `az functionapp cors add`)
    REGWATCH_SHARED_SECRET      optional; when set, callers must send it in
                                the x-regwatch-key header

On what protects this endpoint - worth reading before deploying:

  The origin allowlist stops a browser on another site from using your quota,
  because a browser will not lie about Origin. It is NOT a security boundary:
  curl sends whatever header it likes. It is a cost guard, not a lock.

  A real lock is Easy Auth (Authentication -> Microsoft, require authentication),
  which admits only tenant accounts and needs no code here. Its session cookie is
  same-site, so it works when the page is served from this same Function App -
  which is also how you stop publishing the page itself. See README.md.

  REGWATCH_SHARED_SECRET sits in between: revocable and rate-limitable, but it
  has to reach the browser, so treat it as a throttle rather than a secret. It
  is accepted as a bearer token too, which is what RegWatch's "API key" box
  already sends - so switching to it needs no change in the page.

Nothing about a request is logged beyond its shape. The bodies carry client
questions and regulatory content, and an internal tool has no business keeping
them in Application Insights.

    CORS here is split between two layers, and the split was measured, not
    assumed:

      the preflight   belongs to the platform. The Functions host answers
                      OPTIONS before the function is invoked, so with no origins
                      declared on the Function App it returns 204 with nothing
                      and the browser blocks. `az functionapp cors add` fixes
                      that, and only that.

      the responses   belong to us. Once the platform CORS was configured, a
                      POST still came back with exactly ONE
                      Access-Control-Allow-Origin - ours. The platform does not
                      stamp actual responses here, so dropping these headers
                      would remove them entirely.

    Echoing the caller's origin rather than a wildcard keeps credentialed
    requests possible, which a `*` forbids.
